This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for the corresponding PSU authorising the transaction.The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the payment data with the first POST payments/{payment-product} call.The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation or cancellation sub-resource. This applies in the following scenarios:* The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding Payment Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded by using the extended forms.* 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication' * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'* 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.* The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded by using the extended forms as indicated above.* The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for executing the cancellation.* The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.",

PSD2 TPPs are connecting and are authorized by LUXHUB and\ntheir requests are forwarded towards the ASPSP, with same data and a changed security profile.**\n\n**This API is modeled using Berlin Group v1.3 as a base, with changed security profile. There is no modification of request/response messages whatsoever, compared to the base API, except for additional HTTP headers.\nThe API documentation below is as per base API.**\n\n# Summary\nThe **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of \nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely. \nThe NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards \nin Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,\nenables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') \nby granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.\n\nThe possible Approaches are:\n  * Redirect SCA Approach\n  * OAuth SCA Approach\n  * Decoupled SCA Approach\n  * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method\n  * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available\n  * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method\n\n  Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches. \n  Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional\n  Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support \n  a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.\n\n  **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure \n  which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**\n\n## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:\n* **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.** \n  It is not an replacement in any sense.\n  The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.\n* **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**\n* **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n* According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]\n  \n    \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"\n  \n  The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.\n  \n  The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".\n  \n* There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages, \n  but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.\n  Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.\n  We added them for the convenience of the user.\n  If there is a payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.\n  But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.\n  \n* **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional) \n  except they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n  Therefore the implementer might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements define in this file.\n   \n## General Remarks on Data Types\n\nThe Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least the following characters\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n/ - ? : ( ) . , ' +\n\nSpace\n",
